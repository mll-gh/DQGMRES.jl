### Fast Krylov subspace method for indefinite square systems

Use of incomplete orthogonalization[^1] leads to reduced memory demands compared to the 'full' GMRES algorithm, which stores the entire Krylov Matrix.
Adapted from GMRES implemetation in [IterativeSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl) (this package is in fact a dependency).
