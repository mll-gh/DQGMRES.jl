### Fast Krylov subspace method for indefinite square systems

Use of incomplete orthogonalization[^1] leads to reduced memory demands compared to the 'full' GMRES algorithm, which stores the entire Krylov Matrix.
Adapted from GMRES implemetation in [IterativeSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl), which is in fact a dependency.
Initially developed as a project for CME 338[^2] at Stanford University.
